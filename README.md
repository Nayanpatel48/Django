## Django Key Concepts

### 1. **Model**
- Models are used to create tables inside a database. They define the structure of the database, including fields and their data types.

### 2. **Forms**
- Forms are used to insert data into models (tables). They provide built-in validation and handle data submission from the user.

### 3. **Templates**
- Templates are used to display data. They allow the rendering of HTML with dynamic content passed from views.

### 4. **Class-Based Views (CBVs)**
- CBVs are Python classes that provide methods to handle different HTTP request types (GET, POST, etc.).
- Django offers generic views to reduce boilerplate code for common tasks like CRUD operations.

### 5. **Super User**
- A superuser in Django has full permissions to manage the website and all models through the Django Admin interface.

### 6. **Registering Models**
- To view a model in the admin interface, you need to register your model in the `admin.py` file.

### 7. **Displaying Data on Screen**
- To fetch data from a model/table, a view is created to handle fetching and displaying operations.
